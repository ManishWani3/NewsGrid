          <p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) interim CEO Geoff Allardice on Monday
            said that deciding the World Test Championship (WTC) in a best-of-three final
            is not a realistic idea in a crowded calendar.</p>
          <p>India take on New Zealand in the final at the Ageas Bowl after the two teams
            finished 1-2 on the WTC table. During the current period of the WTC, India played
            6 series and won 12 matches while New Zealand played 5 series and won 7 matches.
            Australia finished at the 3rd spot on the WTC table.</p>
          <p>The WTC was launched in 2019 to create a pinnacle event for five-day international cricket, following the
            successes of the T20 and 50-over world cups. Australia and England were in the race before India and New
            Zealand pulled ahead to grab the top two spots in the WTC final.</p>
          <p>"We were really pleased with the way it played out," Allardice said of the qualification process.</p>
          <p> "It was obvious that the interest in certain series wasn't just restricted to the two teams involved, " he
            said. "It was coming from all over the cricketing world and I think to bring that sort of context to test
            cricket is a real step forward."</p>
          <p>The ICC has approved concussion substitutes as well as Covid-19 replacement, which was introduced last
            year, for this year's final.</p>
